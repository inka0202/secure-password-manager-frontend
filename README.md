Another page where there will be a sign up window with User Name, Password (And Password Stregth Checker), and Email rows. As usual the button beneath them that will sign up.
A page with a small window that will ask for email confirmation after logging in. // ? Maybe an animation of loading with the lines of code? that then will load to the main page?
A main page with some information about the security of user's information, and a text link in the header to the user profile page.
A user profile page, where the user will see and manage his passwords, and where the admins panel will be. // We'll have to think a little bit later on how the admins panel will look like.
